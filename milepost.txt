Target: the plan is to carry on with the payments feature path on in to the admin features to handle order filling, payments capture and notifications. The reason is because these admin features will probably drive model/db schema/layout and I don't want to build the rest of the user features only later to realize I need to make significant model changes that break all my work.

-The admin will log in and process all of farmer bob's apples first
-he'll pull up a list of all tote_items with successful auths in datetime order
-Each toteitem row should have an unchecked checkbox under a “Filled” column
-The sorter puts a check in the box for each order he fills
-When done he hits a 'save' button marking each toteitem as FILLED
-When done with farmer bob's apples he moves on to farmer john's oranges and does the same process
-When all done with this he goes to a 'capture payments' page or something where he sees a list of all filled toteitems about to be charged, sorted by user with a subtotal for each user and a total for the batch. It might be good to show all users' toteitems and have some visual distinction between the filled and the unfilled
-We'll also need to plug notifications in to this and void unused portions of authorizations
-Notifications will go out “right now” for customers who had toteitems not filled
-Delivery notifications will, of course, need to go out upon delivery
