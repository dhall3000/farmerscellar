      <h3>Action Sequence</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Shop, then checkout. (Pretty simple)</li>        
        <li>Your products get delivered to our secure, refrigerated, self serve dropsites</li>
        <li>We notify you via email the moment your products are ready for pickup</li>
        <li>You pickup whenever you want</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Uncommon Aspects</h3>
      Probably the most important things to be aware of are:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Due to product availability constraints you might not actually get everything you order.
        </li>      
        <li>
          Due to the above, we don't actually charge your payment account when you checkout. We wait to collect payment from your authorization until product actually arrives on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you order a variety of products all at the same time, they may get delivered on different days. In that case, feel free to pick each product up the moment it arrives (for maximum freshness) or in one stop once they've all arrived (for maximum convenience). Up to you!
        </li>        
      </ol>

    <div class="anchor" id="the_detailed_version">
      <h2>The Detailed Version</h2>
      <div>                        
        <p>
          We'll flesh this out more as time goes on....
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="anchor" id="commitment_zone">
      <h2>Commitment Zone</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The Commitment Zone is a window of time leading up to product delivery. The size of this time window ("zone") is different for each posting and is specified in each posting's details.  There are two important aspects to understand about this Commitment Zone.</p>
        <p>First is that this "Commitment Zone" date/time functions similarly to an order cutoff. At the moment the Commitment Zone begins the farmer gets notified and begins processing your order. Producers do have access to orders placed after the start of the Commitment Zone. But most producers will set their Commitment Zone at the latest point at which they can process your order and still make delivery. So if you place your order after the Commitment Zone begins it's possible the producer won't even process it.</p>
        <p>Second, the "Commitment" part of "Commitment Zone" means that you (the customer) are obligated to pay if the producer delivers product on your behalf. In other words, you can't back out of your order once your product is in the "Commitment Zone". The reason for this is to protect the farmer from doing a bunch of work (e.g. harvest, package, transport etc.) as a result of your order and then not getting paid for that work. You can always back out of an order prior to the start of the Commitment Zone. But not after.</p>
