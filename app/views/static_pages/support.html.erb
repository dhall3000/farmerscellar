                  Click ‘Shop’, then find the product of interest. Click ‘Order’. If there is a <%= link_to "Group Order Minimum", how_things_work_path(anchor: "order_minimums") %> and it hasn’t been achieved you’ll see a spinning red exclamation point. Click that and you’ll see how much remains to achieve the minimum.

                  If you’ve already ordered and later want to see if a <%= link_to "Group Order Minimum", how_things_work_path(anchor: "order_minimums") %> has been achieved, log in to your Farmer’s Cellar account and go to the black header at the top of the page. Click either ‘Tote’ or ‘Orders’ depending on if you’ve authorized payment or not. If any of the products you’ve selected still have unmet Group Order Minimums you’ll see a spinning red exclamation point. Click that to find out more information.

              To find out detailed information about each posting, first click on 'Shop' to get to the postings page, then find the posting you're interested in. Each 'posting' is laid out with producer name first, then under that is product name. Each of those names has a little icon to the left...if you click that icon it expands to show more information. Expand these little icons and you should find what you're looking for.

            <h3>Email Submitted More than Once</h3>
            <p>
              When you submit your email address to reset your password, it can take a minute or two to get an email response from us...probably a bit longer than you're used to. So the trick is to submit your email address <%= link_to "here", new_password_reset_path %> only <u>once</u> and then just wait.
            </p>
            <p>
              And note: it's <u>ONLY</u> the most recent password reset email you receive that will work. All others will fail. So if you have submitted your email address multiple times you must wait until the last email response from our system is received. Than you should be just fine.
            </p>
            <h3>Account not Activated</h3>
            <p>
              Before you can log in or change your password you must first 'activate' your account. You do this by clicking the link that should have been emailed to you when you signed up for a Farmer's Cellar account. If you haven't done this yet, look in your inbox for an email from us with the subject "Account activation". In the email, click the link that says "Activate".
