                  First browse to the product of interest and click on it. If an unmet Club Order Minimum exists you'll see a <span class="alert-danger">red section</span> below the product photo that will say how much more must be ordered to hit the <%= link_to "Club Order Minimum", how_things_work_path(anchor: "order_minimums") %>.

                <p>
                  If you’ve already ordered and later want to see if a <%= link_to "Club Order Minimum", how_things_work_path(anchor: "order_minimums") %> has been achieved, log in to your Farmer’s Cellar account and click the green company name at the top of any page. Then click either ‘Tote’ or ‘Orders’ to display the products you've selected. If any of the products you’ve selected still have unmet Club Order Minimums you’ll see one of these icons next to it <span class="spin-continuously alert-danger glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>. Whenever you see that icon click it to find out more information.

To find this date/time from your Tote or Orders page, click the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> to the left of any of the item rows. To find this information while shopping first click the product of interest, then click 'Delivery details'.

            <h3>Email Submitted More than Once</h3>
            <p>
              When you submit your email address to reset your password, it can take a minute or two to get an email response from us...probably a bit longer than you're used to. So the trick is to submit your email address <%= link_to "here", new_password_reset_path %> only <u>once</u> and then just wait.
            </p>
            <p>
              And note: it's <u>ONLY</u> the most recent password reset email you receive that will work. All others will fail. So if you have submitted your email address multiple times you must wait until the last email response from our system is received. Than you should be just fine.
            </p>
            <h3>Account not Activated</h3>
            <p>
              Before you can log in or change your password you must first 'activate' your account. You do this by clicking the link that should have been emailed to you when you signed up for a Farmer's Cellar account. If you haven't done this yet, look in your inbox for an email from us with the subject "Account activation". In the email, click the link that says "Activate".
