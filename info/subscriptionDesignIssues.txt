-what if on three consecutive days a person subscribes to 1 dozen eggs, then increases to 2 dozen eggs, then gets 1 gallon of milk?
	-can i have just one reference transaction i tap for this?
	-what if on the fourth day they do a one time beef purchase?

Scenarios
1
-Person has only purchased with guest checkout
-they have a guest checkout auth waiting for fulfillment
-they want to subscribe to eggs so they get flashed a message that requires a pp account + billing agreement (BA)
-the create a BA
-at capture time we look for an active BA. if we find one we charge all (even the guest checkout auth'd items) on that

i was just looking at the db diagram considering where new tables would go and how it would hook up. for example, toteitems curently hook to checkouts -> auths. how would we do the equivalent with RTs?

Here's a list of design issues. Perhaps I should continue to add to this list before beginning coding?

-if i already have a Billing Agreement on file and someone comes and checks out additional products / subscriptions, how do i keep records of that?
-how do i show subscription items in the tote? just leave the item there as long as the subscription is on?
-how do i allow a person to turn a subscription off?
-right at commitment zone startup time i should verify with Paypal that the BA is still legit. if it's not I should remove the toteitem and cancel the subscription.
-before pulling customer funds off a one-time auth i should check if they have a BA. if they have a BA i should pull from that in a batch.
