  test "funds should process on last day of dst week" do
    #as i author this it's monday March 13 2017. daylight savings was just this past weekend. a few weeks ago we changed the start-of-week day. sunday used to mark the
    #start of a new week. we used to disallow deliveries on sundays. consequently, since saturday was the last day of the week to receive deliveries it was also the last
    #day of the week upon which funds would process. they'd process on that day iff there was a delivery on that day (saturday). then mondays were pickup deadline day so
    #deliveries likewise were disallowed on that day.
    #but then we started sourcing from ballard farmer's market which is a sunday thing. so we made it that deliveries are acceptable on all days of the week except monday which
    #remains the pickup deadline day. since sunday is now the last day of the week it should be the last day upon which funds will process
    #but we had a delivery yesterday (sunday) and no funds were processed. we should have pulled purchases from at least one customer. didn't happen. hence this test.
